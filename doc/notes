this calculator operates on a plain text line

if disallowed symbols are present, stop the execution

when input is tokenized, try to convert infix to postfix, at this point there
should be no parenthesis in the converted string, otherwise return empty vector
stopping the execution

if parse succeeds, evaluate the expression and return result
